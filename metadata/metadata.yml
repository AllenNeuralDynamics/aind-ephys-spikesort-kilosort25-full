name: 2023-03-24 v1 Ephys processing pipeline Kilosort2.5
description: |-
  Electrophysiology analysis pipeline using Kilosort2.5 via SpikeInterface.

  The pipeline includes:

  - preprocessing: phase_shift, highpass filter, and 1. common median reference ("cmr") or 2. destriping (bad channel interpolation + highpass spatial filter - "destripe")
  - spike sorting: with KS2.5
  - postprocessing: remove duplicate units, compute amplitudes, spike/unit locations, PCA, correlograms, template similarity, template metrics, and quality metrics
  - curation based on ISI violation ratio, presence ratio, and amplitude cutoff
  - visualization of timeseries, drift maps, and sorting output in sortingview
